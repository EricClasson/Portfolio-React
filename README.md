## My process

When i started this project i first started with doing an figma skiss with the flowdiagram of the components and an all over skiss of the design.
Then im focus was to start from the bottom nav - footer and implementing all the necessary content i needed. Then i implementeted all the JS and the over effects i wanted.

Over all i liked this project, it was a fun exercise for react.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SaSS
- Flexbox
- Grid
- JS
- React
- Psudocode before build - Figjam
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

The project was a bit of recap of what i have been learnd the last few months with html, css and js. So the project i self was good for me to do. The main focus in this was react, to learn all the basics of it. I wanted to try and figure out every problem by my self from start do finish.
